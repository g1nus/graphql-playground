# graphql-playground

This repository will help you understand the basics of GraphQL.

Install the dependencies with the following command

```npm ci```

Then you can run any of the TypeScript files in the `/src` by typing

```npm run {FILE_NAME}``` 

*(there's no need to add the extension of the file)*

### Interaction with REST example (optional)

You may want to create a [weatherbit account](https://www.weatherbit.io/account/create) in order to try out the rest example. You'll have to set your api key into the `apiKey` variable of the `rest_example.ts` file *(line 6)*.
